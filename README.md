B++ is a WIP non-functional programming language developed by Colin McElroy. Currently, the language is unfinished with the current progress on compiler source code in the LangDef directory. B++ is intended to have variable declaration, function declaration, static type-checking, implicit typing, optimized evaluation, and more. Updates will be posted here as progress continues.
