# B++ V0.1

Python version required: **Python 3.8.0+**

B++ is a WIP non-functional programming language developed by Colin McElroy. Currently, the language is unfinished with progress on compiler source code in the LangDef directory. B++ is intended to have variable declaration, function declaration, static type-checking, implicit typing, optimized evaluation, and more. Updates will be posted here as progress continues.

V0.1 Progress:
- Completed string lexing with a small list of symbols.
- Parsing accompanied by a custom CFG that parses variable declarations alongside math expressions.

Test code in the LangDef/Testing/CustomTesting module.
