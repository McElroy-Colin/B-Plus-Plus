# Regal V0.1

Compiler source code in progress.

Regal is a work-in-progress non-functional programming language developed by Colin McElroy. Currently, the language is unfinished with progress on compiler source code in the LangDef directory. Regal is intended to have variable declaration, function declaration, static type-checking, implicit typing, optimized evaluation, and more. Updates will be posted here as progress continues.
